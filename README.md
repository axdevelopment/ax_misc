# AX_MISC
# Usable items for your FiveM ESX server & misc
This script was made to work with [mythic_progbar](https://github.com/HalCroves/mythic_progbar).
Usable items have configurable animations and props, you just have to find the right ones for your
item. The script ist easy to extend/add more items. It also works with okokNotify.
